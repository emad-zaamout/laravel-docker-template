#Docker Template for Laravel

#####Using PHP 8, PHP-FPM, Nginx and PCOV for testing

Server, runs as non root user for enhanced security.

If your new to docker, you can watch my courses at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrw3F3hnsOGRXFJXHo_Ri6w

To use, clone this repo first, then create your laravel project. If you already have your laravel project files created, then clonning wont work because your dir is not empty. in this case just clone files to a new directory, delete the .git file inside the new directory and copy all the fiels to your laravel project. I.e
````
mkdir laravel-docker-template
git clone https://github.com/emad-zaamout/laravel-docker-template laravel-docker-template
rm -rf laravel-docker-template/.git

mv laravel-docker-template/* your_laravel_project_dir
````


Inside your .env file, add the following values for your database
````
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=database_mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=default
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=secret
````
Or adjust the docker-compose.yml accordingly.

I also added an optional Makefile that contains commands to build and start containers. See Makefile or in your terminal write `make` to see list of commands. If you adjusted the container name inside the `docker-compose.yml` make sure to adjust the `CONTAINER_PHP=api` inside the Makefile.

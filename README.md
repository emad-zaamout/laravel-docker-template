##Docker Template for Laravel
#####Using PHP 8, PHP-FPM, Nginx and PCOV for testing

Server, runs as non root user for enhanced security.

To use, clone this repo inside your Laravel project.
Inside your .env file, add the following values for your database
````
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=database_mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=default
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=secret
````
Or adjust the docker-compose.yml accordingly.

I also added an optional Makefile that contains commands to build and start containers. See Makefile or in your terminal write `make` to see list of commands. If you adjusted the container name inside the `docker-compose.yml` make sure to adjust the `CONTAINER_PHP=api` inside the Makefile.
